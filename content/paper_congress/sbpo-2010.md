abstract = "In  supply  chains  of  the  petroleum  industry,  maintaining  balancing  between  production  and  consuming  of  multiple  products  of  petroleum  derivatives  is  a  crucial  issue.  Basically,  this  chain  has several elements like producer bases, consumer bases, intermediary terminals that are linked by  means  of  a  multi-modal  transport  network.  These  elements  should  cooperate  to  reach  the  global balance of the system with the best transport cost. In this context, this paper proposes and compares two solutions based on auctions carry out with agents, which represent the elements of a  supply  chain.  These  solutions  are  characterized  respectively  for  the  execution  of  sequential  auctions  (i.e.  one  auction  per  time)  and  simultaneous  auctions  in  order  to  consumers  bid  for  batches  of  different  kinds  of  petroleum  derivatives.  In  the  comparative  tests  carried  out,  the  solution based on simultaneous auction is better than sequential one mainly because of the more intense cooperation among the agents."
