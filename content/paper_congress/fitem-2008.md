abstract = "Patterns are high-quality solutions that increase the chances of building software projects successfully. However, easier access to these solutions is needed, since it is now necessary to collect patterns from books or spend hours searching for them on the web. If the distributed software development is considered, this problem will be greatly magnified. Thus, it is necessary to find ways to facilitate the access to and use of patterns. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes DISPAM – a Distributed Software Pattern Manager integrated to a distributed software development environment. DISPAM offers adequate support for persistence and search of patterns as well as other functionalities to manipulate them. These functionalities are intended to be applied in software development in an easy and efficient way. Thus, DISPAM will motivate software developers to use patterns and will make their use natural to the developers in their activities."
