abstract = "The transportation planning of oil products in Brazil's multimodal network is a complex problem  that  involves  several  negotiations  between  decentralized  entities  in  order  to agree onthe products to transfer, their amounts,and allocation of shared resources. Due to  such  complexity,adecision  supporting  tools  that can  help  the  decisionmakers  is  a clear  need.  This  paper  presents  a  model to  solve  such  problem based  on  a  new  multi-agent  auction  protocol  and  emphasizes  the  conception  of  bids asa  mannerto  generate better  commitments  for  all involvedentities.The developed  modelis used  to  solvea real scenario of the Brazilian oil supply chain."
