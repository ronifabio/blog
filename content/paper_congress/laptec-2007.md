abstract = "This paper  proposes  a new  programming  paradigm named  Notification Oriented  Paradigm  (NOP)  based  on  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  concepts.  NOP aims at a solution with better performance and openness to parallelism/distribution than  standard  solutions  based  on  current  paradigms,  such  as  the  Object  Oriented languages.  NOP  proposes  to  solve  their  drawbacks,  such  as  inappropriate  syntax, structural/temporal   redundancies,   and   mainly   strongly   coupled   computational entities. This coupling exists due to an orientation to monolithic causal-evaluation process  based  on  search  methods,  which  causes  distribution  difficulties.  Justly, NOP   proposes   another   manner   to   make   evaluations/inferences,   from   rule knowledge,  by  means  of  small,  smart,  and  decoupled collaborative  entities  that interact through notifications."
