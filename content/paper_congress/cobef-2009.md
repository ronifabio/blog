abstract = "The e-mass-customisation is one of the current tendencies in production, in which each client details desired products using e-means. This imposes advances on integration and collaboration of manufacturing entities, aiming at adaptability  to  achieve  production  heterogeneity  and  agility.  An  integration  element  of  management  and  shop  floor systems is the Manufacturing Execution System (MES). It may take into account smart-product technology to deal with customised manufacturing. In this technology, the execution of each order is driven by an entity called smart-product. A  smart-product  requests  and  even  competes  for  services  of  resources,  which  in  turn  collaborate  based on  their features and some flexible logic. However, this collaboration is by itself complex, firstly due to the heterogeneity of the resources. Thus, resources and even smart-products have been “encapsulated” in collaborative entities called Holons (HLs),  for  homogenisation  and  integration  issues.  This  contributes  for  achieving  Holonic  MES  (HMES).  HMES comprises  also  other  issues  like  control  of  the  Holon  dynamics.  In  this  context,  authors’  previous  studies  proposed  a particular  solution,  based  on  “Rules”  and  “Notification”,  for  control  of  Holon  collaborations.  This  solution  was developed  as  a  HMES  meta-model  and  implemented  over  a  simulator  called  ANALYTICE  II,  applied  mainly  onsimulated manufacturing cells. In turn, this paper proposes a meta-model application over a simulated manufacturing plant using ANALYTICE II. The proposed case study takes into account aspects of agility in customised production."
