abstract = "This paper presents a comparative study among default implementations of Genetic Algorithm,  Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization for load balancing, a specific  case of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). Differential Evolution was found the best algorithm, and it was further tested  with  harder GAP  instances  to  determine its best configuration, so asto be applied toother GAP-like problems."
